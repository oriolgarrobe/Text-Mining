It is based on the assumption that less frequently occurring words are more important. In particular, words like: game, fun or app, are very frequent in descriptions of games in the Google Play Store. However, words like zac, or zazz are less frequent, therefore it is assumed that this words have a bigger impact on the meaning of the sentence."
